# TODO

- Use reveal.js (http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/,
  https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) instead of remark.js
    - reveal.js have all the features of remark.js (speaker notes, ...) and
      much more (videos, generate PDF, ...)
- Or even better: rewrite the slides with IPython notebook and generate
  reveal.js slides (+ custom CSS) as explained here:
